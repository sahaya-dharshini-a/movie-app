# 🎬 Movie App - Full Stack MERN Project (Movie Recommendation System)

## 📌 Abstract
In the digital entertainment industry, access to real-time movie data and reviews is an essential requirement. Applications like IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes offer vast movie databases, but building a simplified custom solution helps developers understand key web development principles such as REST APIs, authentication, and asynchronous programming.  
This Movie App demonstrates how modern JavaScript technologies can be combined to build a scalable and modular full-stack system.

---

## 🎯 Objective
The objectives of this project are:
- To develop a full-stack web application for movie search and browsing.
- To implement user authentication (signup and login) using bcrypt.
- To integrate The Movie Database (TMDB) API for fetching dynamic movie data.
- To demonstrate frontend-backend communication via RESTful APIs.
- To ensure responsiveness and scalability of the system.

---

## 🔍 Scope
The Movie App can be extended to support:
- Personalized movie recommendations
- User ratings and reviews
- Watchlists and favourites
- Cloud deployment using Vercel (frontend) and Render / AWS (backend)

---

## ❗ Problem Statement
Developers often face challenges integrating APIs securely while maintaining a clear separation between frontend and backend logic. This project addresses those challenges by demonstrating secure API integration, authentication handling, and database management.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
- **Frontend:** React.js for dynamic UI  
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express for RESTful APIs  
- **Database:** MongoDB for persistent storage  
- **Authentication:** Secure password hashing using bcrypt  
- **External API:** TMDB API for movie data
